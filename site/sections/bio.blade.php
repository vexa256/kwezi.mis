						<p class="text-center">Life is full of golden moments which create the fondest memories forever
							hidden in our hearts. Writing songs is my way of holding on to these sweet and heavenly moments
							with the Lord on the Journey He has lovingly allowed me to walk with Him.

							To me writing songs about Jesus is an expression of love, worship and awe. Itâ€™s one way to keep
							these encounters with Him constantly alive and fresh in my heart. A glimpse into the wondrous
							expressions of His loving heart toward me and you.

							This is an open invite to every listener to enter in and experience these sweet moments with
							the Lord as these songs continually play on. Allow yourself to hear and see Jesus more clearly
							than ever.
							You can not remain the same!!! To Him be all glory evermore!! Stay blessed !!</p>
